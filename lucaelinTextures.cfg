	// If you're adding a new texture, create a new node.
	// The name of the node is the name that will be stored in your craft file.
	// Inside that node, you need two subnodes: sides and ends
	// sides can have the following keys:
		// texture = the path to the texture used for the sides
		// bump = the bump map, if any (shader will be non-bumped if this is left out)
		// uScale = how many times the texture is tiled horizontally around the tank
		// vScale = how many times the texture is tiled vertically on the tank sides
		// autoScale = if present and true, the uScale and vScale will be multiplied by
			// tank radial and vertical stretch factors respectively. Note that the
			// scales will round to the nearest (total scale factor / original scale)
			// so that textures don't have seams. The default sides texture
			// has uScale 4, so it starts tiled 4x horizontally and when stretched will
			// be more or less (but always in steps of 0.25)
		// autoWidthDivide = if present and true, and autoScale is true, divide height
			// scaling by width stretch factor. In other words, a 2x10m SRB and 1x5m SRB
			// will have the same texture scaling. (SegmentedSRB uses this)
		// autoHeightSteps = if present, use steps of (this) instead of (1/vScale) for
			// vertical tiling of the texture (only use when autoScale is true)
	// ends can have just the texture key (see above)
